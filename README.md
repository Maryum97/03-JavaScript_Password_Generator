<b>TITLE:</b> 03-JavaScript: Password Generator

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
This repository contains the second homework assignment for the Coding Bootcamp conducted by the University of Birmingham. This homework assignment was about creating a webpage (application) to generate a random password based on certain criteria. The criteria for the password includes the following:

1. The password must have between 8-128 characters.
2. The password may or may not have lower case, upper case, numeric or special characters, depending on the choice of the employee.

The files pushed to Github for thids homework include the following (descriptions included):

<b>1. <i>index.html:</i></b>
This file, as per usual, provides the basic skeletal structure of the webpage, including the head, the body layout, and the necessary elements inserted into the body of the page, e.g. headings and text.

The head tags contain the links to the external CSS stylesheet (styles.css), and the Bootstrap website for CSS styling of the page, including that for the gutter (textbox), the floating label for the password, and the button. All the elements on the page are styled thoroughly and are fairly responsive, depending on the size of the window.

The body tags contain the script tags at the end, containing the links to the external JavaScript file (script.js) and the Bootstrap website for the animational aspects of the page.

<b>2. <i>script.js:</i><b>
This is the external stylesheet for the index file, to add auxiliary styling for some of the elements on the website. Most of the styling, however, has benn carried out by utilising Bootstrap.

<b>3. <i>styles.css:</i><b>
This is the most important file in this assignment, the JavaScript file, used to make the webpage interactive towards the user (or the employee generating their password).
